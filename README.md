## Introduction

It is difficult to communicate emotions using words. There are too many.
They mean different things to different people. Expressions, however,
are universal.

"Psychological research has classified six facial expressions which
correspond to distinct universal emotions: disgust, sadness, happiness,
fear, anger, surprise [Black,Yacoob,95]. [Source](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/OldStudentProjects/cs490-95to96/HJKIM/emotions.html)

They are also referred to as the [Ekman Expressions](https://www.paulekman.com/universal-facial-expressions/).

Use these Unicode characters to precisely communicate your emotion(s).

## Usage

Select the emotion(s) to add them to the kill-ring, optionally including
their description(s).

Hit n to go forward, p to go backward, RETURN to select a field,
and q to quit.

## Installation

Whatever your preference.

Add it to your load path and

`(require `universal-emotions-emoticons)`
